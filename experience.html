            <p>
                  Worked with Professor Daniel G. Brown on analyzing the ability of LLMs to respond appropriately and consistently to sensitive topics with prompt variations. We analyzed over 30 models, both open and closed source,
                  compared their performance in various areas like task understanding and response consistency. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that most models, even some large open-source models
                  have a difficult time answering simple Yes/No questions and can barely understand the task at hand. They are prone to changing their responses with slight variations in prompt wording and have different responses
                  in different settings. These findings warn us against using LLMs for Q/A without proper planning and testing given their limited instruction-following and task-understanding capacity.
                  <ul>
                        <li>Analyzed the capabilities and limitations of LLMs (Large Language Models) in assessing and updating sensitive statements (e.g. stereotypes, conspiracies, etc). Used HuggingFace, Python, and Tableau.</li>
                        <li>Identified appropriate LLMs by creating a dashboard based on fact-checking, bias detection and instruction-following abilities across 37 open and closed source models. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/tableau_analysis_17014000557090/Sheet1a">Tableau Dashboard Link.</a></li>

            <p>
                  Panelist in SPARCS workshop, Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing. Discussed my research and various opportunities in CS with underrepresented students in 
                  Grade 9-10 across Canada. The aim was to bust the myths of Computer Science and invite inclusivity in the field, to show students how Computer Science is welcoming to all, whether you are math-savvy or not,
                  tech-savvy or not, and what the recent career prospects look like for Computer Science students. Included a short presentation followed by QA session.

                  DIY (Do It Yourself) Track.<br>
                  This summer of code was my introduction to Python and Machine Learning for the first time ever. 
                  Tons of amazing volunteer mentors helped me a lot, from setting up python to understanding support vector machines, random forests.
                  Setting up python and anaconda, in windows(!), was quite messy. Multiple python and too many incompatibility issues. I have come a long way since then.
                  Did a lot of assignments and solved ML problems with the completely hands workshops in this SoC.
