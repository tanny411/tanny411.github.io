            <h1>Research Data Scientist (NLP) <br/> Wikimedia Foundation</h1>
            <p>I worked with the Research Team as a Research Data Scientist (NLP) to develop Copyediting as a structured task. To increase and maintain the standard of Wikipedia articles, it is important to ensure articles don't have typos, spelling, or grammatical errors. While there are ongoing efforts to automatically detect "commonly misspelled" words in English Wikipedia, most other languages are left behind. We intend to find ways to detect errors in articles in all languages in an automated fashion.
                  We used Wiktionary to curate a list of commonly misspelled words and detected misspellings in Wikipedia articles of all languages.  
                  Analysis work: <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Copyediting_as_a_structured_task">Research:Copyediting_as_a_structured_task</a>.
                  <br>
                  Currently, I am working on addressing deployment bottlenecks and improving the Wikipedia link recommendation system accuracy by creating a language-agnostic model to replace the 300+ individual language-dependent models. This ensures we deploy few models instead of 300+ models for each language, as well as improve low-resource languages that do not have enough links to train a model.

                  This summer of code was my introduction to Python and Machine Learning for the first tme ever. 
                  Tons of amazing volunteer mentors helped me a lot, from setting up python to understanding support vector machines, random forests.
                  Setting up python and anaconda, in windows(!), was quite messy. Multiple python and too many incompatibality issues. I have a come a long way since then.
                  Did a lot of assignments and solved ML problems with the completely hands workshops in this SoC.
