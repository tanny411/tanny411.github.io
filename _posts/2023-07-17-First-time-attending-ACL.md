- Do Tutorials!
- Do Workshops!
- In workshops, since there are lesser number of people, dont leave the room in coffee breaks and directly go talk to paper presenters and keynote presenters
- In main conference sessions, come early, sit in the front, see presenters' faces clearly, see where they sit after presenting, go talk to them immediately after session. Maybe join lunch/coffee.
- talk to all companies, ask them for external party/mixer invites ON THE FIRST DAY.
- CHECK EMAIL always. Make sure to receive notifications for mixer invites immediately.
- Attend ALL poster sessions. Make personal connections with presenters.
- Randomly say hi to people and start talking.
- Read all paper abstracts before conference, read full papers of the very relevant ones if available, stalk the authors you want to talk to beforehand, remember their faces, and keep a note of when and where they are going to be during the conference
- Meet more grad students, have lunch/dinner with them
- take pics of posters, take slide pics. Also make note of *how* awesome people are presenting, how their slides are formatted, and how much they put in slides vs speak.
